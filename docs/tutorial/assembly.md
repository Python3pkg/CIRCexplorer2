# *De Novo* Assembly for Circular RNA Transcripts

CIRCexplorer2 employs Cufflinks to carry out *de novo* assembly for circular RNA transcripts, and charaterizes alternative splicing based on the assembled results. So it is the key step before analyzing the landscape of alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing of circular RNA.
